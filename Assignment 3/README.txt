HOMEWORK 3 STA 141C
===================

For this homework, we will try classification and regression using 
datasets listed in https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/. 
The format of data is called \SVMLight" format:
<label> <index>:<value1> <index>:<value2> . . .
Each line contains an instance. For classification, <label> is an integer 
indicating the class label. For regression, <label> is the target value which 
can be any real number. Indices are in ascending order.

SETUP
=====

1. Use Python 3
2. Install sklearn and numpy

ABOUT THE CODE
==============

For problem1part1.py, run code as is.
For problem1part3.py, pass in a step size for the first argument.
For problem1part4.py, pass in a step size for the first argument.

For problem2part1.py, it will be called inside the file proble2part2.py.
For problem2part2.py, pass in a step size for the first argument.
For problem2part3.py, pass in a lambda for the first argument.

For problem3part1.py, run code as is.
For problem3part2.py, run code as is.
For problem3part3.py, run code as is.
